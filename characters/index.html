                <h2>The Rich Man</h2>
                    <a href="rich_man.html">Character 1</a>
                    <p>“ He was a rich man: banker, merchant, manufacturer, and what not. A big, loud man, with a stare, and a metallic laugh. A man made out of coarse material, which seemed to have been stretched to make so much of him… A man who was always proclaiming, through that brassy speaking-trumpet of a voice of his, his old ignorance and his old poverty. A man who was the Bully of humility.”<br><br><br></p>
                <h2>He Wore Glasses</h2>
                    <a href="glasses.html">Character 2</a>
                    <p>“Besides that, he wore glasses. He was nearly blind in his left eye, and said left eyes were the tribal curse of the Finches. Whenever he wanted to see something well, he turned his head and looked from his right eye.”<br><br><br></p>
                <h2>Mrs. Flowers</h2>
                    <a href="mrs_flowers.html">Character 3</a>
                    <p>“Her skin was a rich black that would have peeled like a plum if snagged, but then no one would have thought of getting close enough to Mrs. Flowers to ruffle her dress, let alone snag her skin. She didn’t encourage familiarity. She wore gloves too. I don’t think I ever saw Mrs. Flowers laugh, but she smiled often. A slow widening of her thin black lips to show even, small white teeth, then the slow effortless closing. When she chose to smile on me, I always wanted to thank her.”<br><br><br></p>
                <h2>Perfect Ears</h2>
                    <a href="ears.html">Character 4</a>
                    <p>“She was twenty-one, with an attractive slender body and a pair of the most bewitching, perfectly formed ears… I would have to say her natural gifts ran to ear modeling […] I am my ears, my ears are me.”<br></p><br>
